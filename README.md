# bingocards
Generate bingo cards in R

This code generates classic numbered bingo cards, pulling random non-duplicate samples for each column and writes the cards out as jpeg files. The base of this code is creating a function called bingocards. After creating the function, you can enter the number of cards you want, and the output will be separate, uniquely generated jpeg files. For example, bingocards(100) will generate and save 100 bingo cards. 

This function makes classic bingo cards; for text-based bingo game cards, check out: https://github.com/jennybc/bingo. 

Happy bingo playing!
